The aim of the ```end-to-end analysis``` is to analyse the efficiency of an online store with a focus on evaluating its marketing efforts.

The online store operates on Shopify and currently advertises only on the Meta platform.

The analysis demonstrates my ability to ```extract, transform, and analyse``` marketing data to provide actionable insights into Marketing efficiency.

Overview of the analysis:

- Extraction of data from Meta API - Python
- Loaded and transformed data - SQL 
- Data visualisation and analysis - Power BI

Audience of the dashboard:

- The whole marketing team including the team lead, hence, the KPI cards and trend lines are provided at the top of the dashboard for a quick overview and the table at the bottom for deep dive
