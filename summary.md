The aim of the ```end-to-end analysis``` is to analyse the efficiency of an online store with a focus on evaluating its marketing efforts. The dashboard created for the analysis will be used by whole marketing team including the team lead.

The online store operates on Shopify and currently advertises only on the Meta platform.

The analysis demonstrates my ability to ```extract, transform, and analyse``` marketing data to provide actionable insights into Marketing efficiency.

Overview of the analysis:

- Extraction of data from Meta API - Python
- Loaded and transformed data - SQL 
- Data visualisation and analysis - Power BI
