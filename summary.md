The aim of the ```end-to-end analysis``` is to analyse the efficiency of an online store with a focus on evaluating its marketing efforts.

The online store operates on Shopify and currently advertises only on the Meta platform.

The analysis demonstrates my ability to ```extract, transform, and analyse``` marketing data to provide actionable insights into Marketing efficiency.

Overview of the analysis:

- Extraction of data from Meta API - Python

- Loaded and transformed data - SQL
  
- Data visualisation and analysis - Power BI

Approach followed:

- Requirement Gathering: The business goal and audience were understood, and KPIs were defined
  
- Data Requirements: Through following top-down approach for KPIs defined, the columns needed for analysis were identified

- Data Orchestration: ELT was executed to make raw data usable for the analysis

- Data Analysis: The visualizations were created in Power BI (keeping the audience in mind), and analysis was conducted using the KPIs defined

- Insights and Recommendations- The analysis helped to find meaningful information and provide recommendations that will optimize marketing efforts

Audience of the dashboard:

- The whole marketing team, including the team lead, hence, the KPI cards and trend lines are provided at the top of the dashboard for a quick overview and the table at the bottom for deep dive

Disclaimer:

- Due to data privacy, instead of the Power BI (.pbix) file, a PDF form of the dashboard is uploaded. The data in the PDF is anonymised or kept blank for the same purpose.

Learnings:

- Experienced the broad perspective in analysis from requirements gathering to creating a database to analysis

- Helped in understanding the backend as well as the frontend side of analysis
